# SimFi Rewards Engine (Reference Implementation)

This repository is a reference implementation of the SimFi Rewards Engine logic (Bags.fm fee claim + reward allocation).
It is intentionally NOT a standalone runnable server repo (there is no package.json).

Use this repo to:
- Review the engine logic
- Copy files into an existing SimFi backend (Express/Fastify/etc.)
- Apply the DB migration and schema patch in the main repo

If you want a runnable demo, integrate this into your SimFi backend repository.
